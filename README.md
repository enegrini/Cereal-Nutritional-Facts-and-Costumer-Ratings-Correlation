# **Relation between cereal nutritional fact and costumer rating**

### **Introduction:** 
Sometimes eating a perfectly balanced breakfast in the morning is hard and thus we usually turn to eating cereal.
Believe it or not, healthy cereal does exist. In fact, it was invented as a low-fat health product to deliver more fiber to our bodies.
The trouble comes when trying to distinguish those cereals that are good for you from those that just pretend to be.
Misleading labels and advertising don't help, but looking at the nutritional facts does. 
We will look at the nutritional facts and rating of 76 breakfast cereals to understand some relationships.
For example, is the amount of calories dependent on sugar, fiber, or carbohydrates? Or perhaps all of the above? 
According to studies “Breakfast Cereals: Healthy or Unhealthy?” (see Healthline, Healthline Media, www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-breakfast-cereals-healthy)
sugar, fiber, and whole grains are what people look at the most when choosing a breakfast cereal. 
It makes sense that when being rated we will look at these ingredients since we're trying to be healthy. 
We will look at the rating and compare with the sugar and the fiber to see if this is true. 

### **The Data:**
For this project we used the Kaggle cereal data set ^[Crawford, Chris. “80 Cereals.” Kaggle, 24 Oct. 2017, www.kaggle.com/crawford/80-cereals.].
This data set contains cereal name, manufacturer name, rating and nutritional facts such as sugar per serving, carbohidrates per serving, etc.

### **Conclusion:**
We disxovered that big part of the calories come from the amount of sugar, carbohydrates and fat. 
People also rate a cereal based on how low the sugar is and how much fiber it has. 
Ready-to-eat breakfast cereal can make for a convenient, healthy and balanced breakfast, especially if it's made with whole grains, is low in sugar and is served with fresh fruit. Pay attention to portion sizes, and always read the ingredients list. Cereal is healthy only if you choose wisely.
